# How to run the application:
    To be able to play the game you must have ANSII standard 
    enabled on your computer.

    We made two different JAR files, one for the server and
    the other one for the client.
    To launch them you need to use your machine's command line
    and type:
    java -jar +absolute path/.jar 
    You can also reach the directory where is saved the JAR file 
    that you want to run and then type:
    java -jar +JAR file's name

    If you decide to run server app you need to insert your
    IP address (one where you will be reachable).
    If you decide to run client app you need to insert server's IP
    address that you want to get connected to.
